Weekend project to build a clone of the NYT's [C\*nnections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections).

Completely unrelated to that other game other than the concept and gameplay and design. ðŸ¤”

This is not and probably will not ever be deployed anywhere [for reasons](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301557/new-york-times-connections-creator-take-down).

(If you somehow find a `connections.json` file [somewhere](https://github.com/Eyefyre/NYT-Connections-Answers/blob/main/connections.json), you can drop it in the `src/data` folder)

Built with:

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [tanstack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
